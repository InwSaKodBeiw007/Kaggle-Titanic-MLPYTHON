# first model Machine learning 
this compare data between kaggle's data i mean, so that will let the model choose this 0 for sure because he know by the data you've train 0,0 is 1 then if not 0,0 he will think its 0 ><
## "inoutTestTitanic.py" 
this file i check how predict() will come if thats data is no along in the train_data.
so its coming nice tho! i will test this mechanic in real test.csv that come from kiggle
