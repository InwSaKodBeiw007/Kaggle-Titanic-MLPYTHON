# ~~first model Machine learning~~
this compare data between kaggle's data i mean, so that will let the model choose this 0 for sure because he know by the data you've train 0,0 is 1 then if not 0,0 he will think its 0 ><

## `**inoutTestTitanic.py**`
this file i check how predict() will come if thats data is no along in the train_data.
so its coming nice tho! i will test this mechanic in real test.csv that come from kiggle.

##  `**spiltout-trainMe.py**`
is way cool to split ur datasets after u cleansing them, then 
train_test_split will do the job for u.

---
#### example
his ability will cut the ( data, target ) to 2 sets of data and target 
```python

a_data,b_data,a_target,b_target = train_test_split(a,b)
```
data, data, target, target | y'all can see these magics!! <3
